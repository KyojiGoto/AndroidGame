Opening the project directly will work, no extra is needed. Specifically open the Game folder inside
for running the game.

Diagrams in 123.pdf and UML.pfd in folder.

Instructions:
Do not hit the back button. While this will not crash the game, it may cause some minor bugs. Also
do not rapidly double click anything.
Hitting Game1 in the main menu will reset stats and "start a new game".

Game1:
Click/tap and drag to move player, or you can tilt if you are on mobile. Gain points by hitting
rising platforms and bouncing off them. Avoid spikes from top and bottom of screen or else you lose
lives. Harder difficulty means faster rising platforms.

Lives counter in top right of Game1 do not represent total lives, but rather the number of lives
until that particular instance of the game ends.

Game2:
Select type of Riddle/Trivia then answer the 6 questions provided. Wrong answers lose lives and
right answers gain points.

Game3:
Player can either attack or defend. Attacking reduces the Enemy's HP greatly but the Enemy also does
more damage. Defending is a safer option, the Enemy is less likely to deal more damage. Every so
often there will be a health potion floating around, tapping that increases the Player's HP. The
goal is to get the enemy's HP to 0 by strategically either defending or attacking. The score is
given by the remaining HP left. Player loses 10 lives for losing a game and none for winning.
